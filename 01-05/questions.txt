Read about a unix command on the man page.
What command did you read about? What does it do?

I read about the sort command. It sorts the lines of a text file.
By default, the whole line is taking as the input but keys can
be specified. It can also reverse sort by adding -r after sort.

Describe 2 methods that strings have but symbols don't and vice versa.
Pick a method defined on the Enumerable class (arrays, etc).
What does it do and when might you use it?

Methods that strings have but symbols don't:
str*integer --> outputs a string containing integer number of copies of
 the string, where the integer is >=0

str<<obj --> returns a string with object concatenated to the string

Methods in symbol not in strings:
to_proc --> it returns a Proc object. A Proc object is some code bound
to a local variable.

id2name --> Returns the string or name corresponding to symbol

Method defined on the Enumerable class:
take(n) --> returns the first n elements of an array. Might be used to find
if a string is a substring of another string.
